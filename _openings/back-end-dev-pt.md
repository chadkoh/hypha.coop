<a href='https://hypha.coop'>Hypha Worker Co-operative</a> (Hypha) is looking for a part-time developer to work on back end software development for the Distributed Press API.

Ideally, you are excited about participating in a co-operative, building the solidarity economy, and engaging in discussions on rethinking social structures and the politics of technologies.

* Basic or greater knowledge of Linux command line
* Experience setting up web services on Linux
* Experience with systemd and Ansible (not mandatory)
* Knowledge of HTTP server API design patterns / security practices
* Experience working with, supporting, or contributing to an open source project 
* Experience with collaborative development and remote working tools, such as source code repositories, bug trackers, project boards, chat, and videoconferencing 
* Ability to work independently and participate collaboratively in a distributed team environment
* Strong planning, analytic, and problem-solving skills with the ability to multitask and meet deadlines
* Excellent time management skills and the ability to prioritize work
* Clear and compassionate oral, written, and public communication skills
* 3+ years of related work experience
* Demonstrated commitment to the principles of equity and diversity with alignment on Hypha’s <a href="https://handbook.hypha.coop/vision.html">mission and values</a>
