<a href='https://hypha.coop'>Hypha Worker Co-operative</a> (Hypha) is looking for an <b>intermediate Front End Developer</b> to work on several exciting projects at the intersection of arts/culture and technology. <!-- more --> You will work as the lead developer on a small but dedicated team of strategists and designers to bring these projects to life. This full-time position is a contract to start, with the potential to become a permanent co-op member.

Hypha is a tech co-operative, so we do things <a href="https://hypha.coop/dripline/how-we-co-operate/">a little differently</a> (and a little better, we like to think). Ideally, you are excited about participating in a co-operative, building the solidarity economy, and engaging in discussions on rethinking social structures and the politics of technologies.
## Here are some of the things you’ll do
As a Front End Developer, you will be working on several different, technologically diverse, projects. In this role, we’ll ask you to:  

* Work closely with the UX lead and project team to design and code new features for our projects intersecting art, publishing, and decentralized technologies
* Collaborate with the project team to determine how to extend features on a radical rethinking of an online meeting tool for artists and cultural workers (think: the anti-Zoom)
* Work with designers to support the development of the next issue of <a href="https://two.compost.digital/about/">COMPOST</a>, a magazine about the digital commons, which is built on a static site generator and published onto the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)
* Contribute to various front end projects across decentralized technology and Web3 ecosystems
* Lead code reviews, and conduct reviews of proposed technologies and tools to ensure best fit
* Assist with creating various forms of technical documentation for these open source projects

Our technical stack includes: 
* In-house software expertise covering Go, Rust, and Python
* Static site generators like Hugo, Jekyll, and Gatsby, often published onto the Decentralized Web (DWeb) in addition to the World Wide Web (WWW)
* Infrastructure and CI/CD systems using GitHub Actions, Ansible, and Docker, targeting cloud environments and high-security dedicated machines

## Qualifications and skills we are looking for
* 2+ years of front end (or full stack) development experience
* Experience with front end JavaScript frameworks, such as React or Vue.js 
* Expertise in HTML, CSS, with a passion for developing intuitive, well-designed user interfaces 
* Familiarity with static site generators including Hugo and Jekyll 
* Basic or greater knowledge of Linux command line 
* Experience setting up web services on Linux
* Knowledge of HTTP server API design patterns / security practices
* Experience with peer to peer (p2p) protocols is a huge bonus
* Ability to think creatively and didactically about technology, design, and building socio-technical systems
* Knowledge of Agile and Scrum software development approaches
* Well-rounded project management skills
* Experience working with supporting or contributing to an open source project
* Proficiency with collaborative development and remote working tools, such as source code repositories, bug trackers, project boards, chat, and videoconferencing 
* Ability to work independently and collaborate in a distributed team environment
* Strong planning and problem-solving skills with the ability to multitask and meet deadlines
* Clear and compassionate oral, written, and public communication skills
* Demonstrated commitment to the principles of equity and diversity with alignment on Hypha’s <a href="https://handbook.hypha.coop/vision.html">mission and values</a>
