<a href='https://hypha.coop'>Hypha Worker Co-operative</a> (Hypha) is looking for an Operations Coordinator who is part administrative magician, part finance <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/words/factotum">factotum</a>, and ideally has a dash of project management experience. The ideal candidate is highly organized, detail-oriented, familiar with working in a remote-first workplace, and adept at managing a range of operations tasks. This <b>part-time</b> role supports Hypha’s internal work and is not client-facing.

Hypha is a co-operative, so we do things <a href="https://hypha.coop/dripline/how-we-co-operate/">a little differently</a> (and a little better, we like to think). Ideally, you are excited about participating in a co-operative, building the solidarity economy, and engaging in discussions on rethinking social structures and the politics of technologies.

## Here are some of the things you’ll do

The Operations Coordinator will work with the Operations and Finance Working Groups and project leads to fulfill a range of responsibilities:

* Provide administrative support to the co-operative, including managing group calendars, meeting scheduling and other related responsibilities as required  
* Support Operations Working Group on HR-related tasks including posting job openings, scheduling interviews and assisting with employee onboarding  
* Work with the Finance Working Group and bookkeeper to process invoices, make payments, and track receipts, and manage fiscal forecasting tools  
* Support Finance Working Group on payroll and other employment paperwork  
* Assist project leads with establishing and managing project scope, timelines, and budgets  
* Work with project leads to track and manage activities, resources, and plans related to development work and overall project goals  


## Qualifications and skills we are looking for


* Previous operations experience, preferably in a remote-first organization
* Intermediate familiarity with operational finance and budgeting processes
* Experience managing projects or programs
* Highly organized and very detailed-oriented
* Able to manage multiple tasks and deliverables with ease
* Ability to make administrative and procedural decisions on sensitive, confidential issues
* Outgoing and motivated, with the ability to take on tasks without immediate direction
* Ability to work independently and participate collaboratively in a distributed team environment; experience working in a remote-first team is highly preferred
* Excellent time management skills and the ability to prioritize work
* Clear and compassionate oral and written communication skills
* Demonstrated commitment to the principles of equity and diversity with alignment on Hypha’s <a href="https://handbook.hypha.coop/vision.html">mission and values</a>
