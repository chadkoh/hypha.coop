<a href='https://hypha.coop'>Hypha Worker Co-operative</a> (Hypha) is looking for a Senior DevOps Engineer to work on
client projects related to the Decentralized Web. You’ll be working with a team of engineers, strategists, researchers, community-organizers, and artists who bring a wealth of experience in decentralized technologies–from local mesh networks to Web3 community governance. As a member-worker governed workspace without investors, Hypha has the luxury to contribute exclusively to meaningful projects large and small, while collaborating with value-aligned initiatives from across the globe and right here in Toronto.

Hypha is a co-operative, so we do things <a href="https://hypha.coop/dripline/how-we-co-operate/">a little differently</a> (and a little better, we like to think). Ideally, you are excited about participating in a co-operative, building the solidarity economy, and engaging in discussions on rethinking social structures and the politics of technologies.

## Here are some of the things you’ll do

As a contractor, you will work with us to improve our internal server infrastructure and support the delivery of client projects. You will be designing infrastructural systems to support leading edge Web3 and distributed protocols, which range from internal tooling to production services used by clients and the public.

### Activities include:

<ul>
<li>Providing guidance on DevOps best practices, tooling, and infrastructure providers based on our business needs</li>
<li>Implementing infrastructure-as-code for reproducible development, staging, and production environments</li>
<li>Designing reliable workflows that are operationally and programmatically secure</li>
<li>Producing high quality documentation for public and internal use</li>
<li>Developing systems that ensure high availability of our services. You will be building upon our existing automation and CI systems, backup policies, monitoring and alerting tools, and knowledge management solutions</li>
<li>Developing orchestration and monitoring tools for Cosmos blockchain nodes and other decentralized protocols (e.g., IPFS, Filecoin)</li>
<li>Providing infrastructure support to enable one-off and partner initiatives. Some of our past projects include our Digital Garden and COMPOST magazine</li>
</ul>

### Our technical stack includes: 

<ul>
<li>In-house software expertise covering Go, Rust, and Python</li>
<li>Static site generators like Hugo, Jekyll, and Gatsby, often published onto the Decentralized Web (DWeb) in addition to the World Wide Web (WWW)</li>
<li>Infrastructure and CI/CD systems using GitHub Actions, Ansible, and Docker, targeting cloud environments and high-security dedicated machines</li>
</ul>

## Qualifications and skills we are looking for

<ul>
<li>3+ years of experience in an infrastructure team that operates on modern DevOps practices</li>
<li>A bachelor’s degree in Engineering, Computer Science, or related technical field such as Physics or Mathematics</li>
<li>A strong commitment to design maintainable production-grade infrastructure and with</li>
<li>security best practices</li>
<li>Proficiency with Docker, Ansible, Terraform, or other containerization and orchestration technologies</li>
<li>Comfortable scripting and writing simple programs in Bash, Python, and Go</li>
<li>Experience working with both cloud-based and dedicated server environments</li>
<li>Familiarity with cloud providers such as Digital Ocean and Google Cloud</li>
<li>Well-rounded project management skills</li>
<li>Ability to think creatively and didactically about technology, design, and building socio-technical systems</li>
<li>Knowledge of Agile and Scrum software development approaches</li>
<li>Experience working with, supporting, or contributing to an open source project</li>
<li>Experience with collaborative development and remote working tools, such as source code repositories, bug trackers, project boards, chat, and videoconferencing</li>
<li>Ability to work independently and collaborate in a distributed team environment, and with collaborators across different time zones</li>
<li>Strong planning and problem-solving skills with the ability to multitask and meet deadlines</li>
<li>Excellent time management skills and the ability to prioritize work</li>
<li>Clear and compassionate oral, written, and public communication skills</li>
<li>Demonstrated commitment to the principles of equity and diversity with alignment on Hypha’s mission and values</li>
</ul>
