Hypha Worker Co-operative (Hypha) is looking for a Junior Web Designer to redesign and
develop Hypha’s website (hypha.coop). There is also the possibility of assisting on external
client projects. This is an ideal position for anyone just starting out in tech and interested in
working with a non-profit co-operative. The candidate must possess solid design sensibilities
and have excellent front-end development skills. You should bring creativity and technical
skills to produce interesting and informative web design and content. Solid communication,
project management, and organization skills are key, as you’ll be working collaboratively with
Hypha members and employees.
Hypha is a co-operative, so we do things a little differently (and a little better, we like to think).
Ideally, you are excited about participating in a co-operative, building the solidarity economy,
and engaging in discussions on rethinking social structures and the politics of technologies.
Here are some of the things you’ll do
You will work with Hypha workers and employees to lead the redesign and development of
our website. Your tasks could include:
● Produce web design layout options using wireframes, flow diagrams or storyboards
● Create a project plan for the redesign and development of hypha.coop
● Collaborate with Hypha workers and employees to redesign the look and content for
the homepage, blog and other pages as required
● Adhere to and build on our existing brand guidelines in your work
● Iterate and improve new designs based on user feedback
● Take ownership of translating your designs to the web, using a static site generator
● Lead the QA and debugging process for the refreshed site
Qualifications and skills we are looking for
● Current or recently graduated post-secondary student, ideally from a web design,
computer science, software engineering, or related program
● A basic understanding of the entire web design and development process, through to
user testing, and debugging
● Some knowledge of design accessibility
● Must be fluent with desktop design programs such as InDesign, Illustrator or similar
● Must be fluent with HTML 5, CSS 3, Markdown; fluency in Jekyll, Ruby, Node.js is an
asset
● Familiarity with static site generators is highly beneficial
● Experience with collaborative and remote working tools, such as version control (e.g.
Git), productivity tools, chat, task managers and project boards, and video
conferencing software
● Ability to work independently and collaborate in a distributed team environment
● Strong planning and problem-solving skills; ability to multitask and meet deadlines
● Excellent time management skills and the ability to prioritize work
● Clear and compassionate oral, written, and presentation skills
● Demonstrated commitment to the principles of equity and diversity with alignment on
Hypha’s mission and values
