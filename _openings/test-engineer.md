## Overview

**Location:** Remote

**Compensation:** 84,396 - 109,647 CAD

**Time commitment:** 4 days/week

**Application deadline:** January 22, 2024

**Start date:** February 12, 2024

[Hypha Worker Co-operative](https://hypha.coop/) (Hypha) is looking for a **mid-level software engineer** with experience (or interest) in test automation to join the Cosmos Hub Team. This team stewards the Cosmos Hub’s Testnets Program – a public testnet where app developers, chain builders, and validators can take things for a spin before they hit production. Don’t worry if you don’t know what all those words mean – we don’t require specialized knowledge in Cosmos, any specific blockchain, or blockchain technologies in general. You’ll stand out if you’re interested in learning about this domain, though. 

Hypha is a co-operative, so we do things [a little differently](https://hypha.coop/dripline/how-we-co-operate/) (and a little better, we like to think). Ideally, you are excited about participating in a co-operative, building the solidarity economy, and engaging in discussions on rethinking social structures and the politics of technologies.


## Here are some of the things you’ll do

You will be working alongside two other engineers and the Testnets Program Lead. Most of your time will be spent on writing and maintaining an automated test suite and building tools to support testing processes:

* Design and develop code related to blockchain and peer-to-peer systems
* Implement features for software release testing and network analysis
* Write code to investigate performance improvements and new features
* Maintain and improve build and test workflows using Bash, Python, and Ansible playbooks
* Plan, execute, and report on test network deployments
* Create detailed test plans and test cases
* Monitor network infrastructure
* Maintain technical documentation such as readmes, how-tos and wikis in public and private repositories
* Perform operational tasks during our testnet event days
* Gather data to support the Testnets Program Lead in writing reports

We are a small, cross-functional team, so you also may be asked to pitch in with other things, like:

* Communicating with our partner teams to support the Testnets Program Lead
* Making announcements on Discord to help publicize scheduled events
* Helping community members debug their nodes on Discord

Our technical stack includes: 

* In-house software expertise in Bash and Python
* Infrastructure and CI/CD systems using GitHub Actions, Ansible, and Docker, targeting cloud environments and high-security dedicated machines


## Qualifications and skills we are looking for

**Requirements:**

* 3-5 years of professional programming experience
* Willingness to jump in and help out with other disciplines when needed
* Ability to replicate work based on an example and generalize to other similar scenarios
* Ability to work independently and participate collaboratively in a distributed team environment
* Ability to communicate effectively with your teammates, including asking for help when stuck
* Strong planning, analytic, and problem-solving skills with the ability to multitask and meet deadlines
* Interest in learning about the Cosmos ecosystem and blockchain technologies
* Experience with in Python and/or Golang as well as general shell scripting
* Experience with Git/GitHub
* Passionate about working in a worker cooperative environment

**Nice to have:**

* Experience working with, supporting, or contributing to an open source project
* Experience working remotely in a distributed team
* Experience with Infrastructure as Code and build automation systems (bonus if you have used Ansible)
* Experience writing automated tests using GitHub Actions
* Experience contributing to blockchain projects (bonus if this is in the Cosmos ecosystem)
* Interest in cybersecurity
