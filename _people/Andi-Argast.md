Working in communications in the early 2000s, Andi Argast contributed to the rise of social media and has gone through many hype cycles since then.  


As she’s built her mastery in applying emerging technologies, she’s always fed her curiosity about how to use technology’s growing power for good. Andi’s experiences span the nonprofit, library sciences, government, and education sectors, and have included leadership roles at Girl Guides of Canada, the Ontario Ministry of Research, Innovation and Science, and the Toronto Node of the Open Data Institute. An expert in raising digital literacy and building usable tech through [human-centered design](https://vimeo.com/106505300), Andi believes the key to doing good is understanding the toolset — something she helps her clients and team do every day as Hypha’s Strategy Lead.
