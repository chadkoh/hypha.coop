Lexa is a fledgling anarchist with two degrees in management engineering and sciences from the University of Waterloo. 

Her academic background combines software, operations research, and organizational design, while her personal interests include self-organizing teams, strong human relationships, and governance. As a lover of both improv and perfectly-executed plans, Lexa is constantly trying to find the equilibrium between structure and chaos.
