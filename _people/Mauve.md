Mauve Signweaver has been “poking computers” since they were a child — their first time on one predates their earliest memory.  


Mauve’s obsession with technology outpaced their family’s means very soon, so they’ve long been intimate with working around resource constraints. What began as figuring out how to do things with less has now transformed into a mission to spread peer to peer and mesh technology based on its wider merits. This technology is not only more affordable, but more reliable, resilient, and self-governed than the cloud solutions that dominate the market today. Mauve regularly consults, speaks, and publishes on this topic on their [blog](https://blog.mauve.moe/) and at conferences like [Causal Islands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSvj_NQ5rho).
