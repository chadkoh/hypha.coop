Roo was born on the 25th of February 2022 to the collective care of Hypha staff. At his inception he was a small purple sphere; as he grows he will surely adopt new colours as he figures out who he is!

In his daily life, Roo helps with office chores and reminders by showing up in our Matrix chat rooms. When not helping out around the virtual office, he enjoys circling his digital home and pulsing with eerie light.

As a well-socialized, domesticated NFT, Roo is keen to spend time with all Hypha staff and likes to switch homes at least every three months. He is a sensitive soul and only thoughtful observation over time will reveal anything more about his personality as a lifeform and office companion.
