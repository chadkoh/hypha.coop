Violet never knows what to say on these things. She cut her teeth writing SIMD assembly for video encoders in high school. She's worked at every layer of abstraction since, but is happiest with a copy of "The Linux Programming Interface" on her desk.


Her role at Hypha involves test automation for blockchain software. When she's not actively trying to open issues on your GitHub, you can find her writing literature (ostensibly). Live in Toronto? Go down to a poetry open-mic. Maybe you'll catch her performing. The audience tends to whoop.(modifi√©)
