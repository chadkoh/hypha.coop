### {{ page.excerpt }}
In the Spring of 2021 Hypha was invited by From Later, friends and foresight studio in Toronto, to participate in a micro-residency as part of The Bentway’s Digital and/as Public Space initiative that included the creation of a mobile game to meander public spaces and a Field Guide. The micro-residency brought together six talented artists, researchers, and designers to examine tensions in navigating the possibilities of online and offline public spaces; an exploration of “the interaction between digital and physical space in order to re-examine public space, overcome access barriers, promote civic engagement, and support community resilience in online, offline, and hybrid contexts.”

Where does one start? The previous year had been the founding of Hypha, and a sort of up-rooting experienced by many, and the invitation to participate in the micro-residency turned out to be a fitting prompt for reflecting on what gave us the motivation to work together and experiment in ways of producing research about the future and the past of networks, which is both legible and expressive.

Our micro-residency contribution, The Digital Garden and cultivated narrative Does the internet dream of…?, was created with this in mind and spirit. These pieces are a sprawl of interconnected references that inform a set of three retro-futurist narratives based on how we saw network infrastructure, protocols, and communities, reanimated to create a possible future that is vibrant and equitable.

Hypertext, RSS (RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication), and publishing were initial seeds in our garden from which connections were made to initiatives by Hypha members like Distributed Press, the artist practice of Mierle Laderman Ukeles, and projects that have lingered in our minds like Community Memory and RSS.

## On Digital Gardens

At the start of the micro-residency we had a variety of references and concepts we wanted to capture. This could have easily taken the form of a document accessible only to those closest to the project. However, there was a definite affinity in making our process and notes public when we really considered the theme of the initiative. This is where the concept of a Digital Garden came to mind; a public notebook of loose thoughts and, in itself, a reference to how technologies like Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) was originally introduced to transverse documents and allow for emergent connections that are unbounded by chronological order and bi-directional (a thought is structurally connected to another thought and vice versa. Everything is deeply intertwingled). One could transverse the garden via those inline links, or through  visualization nodes and edges representing those connections; a sort of knowledge graph.
