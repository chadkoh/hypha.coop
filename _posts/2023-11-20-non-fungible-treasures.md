### {{ page.excerpt }}

As an artist immersed in the realms of blockchain and smart contract exploration, my time in early October in New Orleans at an event hosted by Wild.xyz, presented a unique opportunity. There, amidst a diverse assembly of artists and thinkers, I engaged in rich dialogues about the nuances of smart contract art, a field where I have been actively contributing. This experience served not just as a great party and wonderful networking occasion but as a fertile ground for exchanging groundbreaking ideas, further fueling my creative and technological pursuits.

Since returning from this invigorating environment, I have launched the 'Hawking Radiation' project and attended the Autonomous Worlds Assembly, each step reinforcing my commitment to this innovative space. Drawing inspiration from Ursula K. Le Guin's 'Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction,' which views stories as vessels for collective human experiences, I've been exploring NFTs and smart contracts as modern 'carrier bags.' These are the digital narratives and artistic expressions that hold immense potential to shape new worlds and experiences—a concept I have been keenly developing in light of my recent engagements. 


Among the innovative NFT projects that caught my attention this year was the [Blackhole](https://blackhole.eth.limo/), a minimal yet profound smart contract art piece. In essence, it’s a digital representation of a black hole where participants can interact by minting or burning NFTs, affecting its state and the cost of future interactions. Each action directly influences the Blackhole's lifecycle, echoing the unpredictable and dynamic nature of its cosmic namesake.

Fascinated by this project, I ventured to create the [Hawking Radiation](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9dCEaa80E2500B519090a6d8a1FfeDfe224Ceb8D#code), a smart contract enabling a collective approach to interacting with the Blackhole. This initiative allowed participants to burn their tokens via the Hawking Radiation mechanism, turning the individualistic experience into a cooperative mission. The goal was to socialize the experiment, fostering a community-driven effort to 'play' the Blackhole in a cooperative mode. This shift not only added a layer of social dynamics to the experience but also highlighted the potential of blockchain for creating collaborative and shared art experiences.  

"NFTs are worthless!"—this statement, frequently used as a click-bait headline— casually dismisses the possibilities enabled by distributed databases such as blockchains. Such statements, other than showing a definitive lack of nuance, serve as a reminder of the misconception towards the affordances of such decentralized technologies. As an artist committed to technological explorations, my curiosity tends to lead me towards the potentialities opened up by a specific medium. I see NFTs as a medium that can explore the social, financial, and technical ramifications of blockchains, offering a distinct material for creativity. My interest in distributed ledgers as a vehicle for creativity has led me to take part in season 2 of [Wild](https://wild.xyz)'s residency.  

Wild is a platform celebrating art and creativity in the digital age. Their primary objective is to empower artists with tools for growth, to provide space for creativity, and to introduce their art to a wider audience. My involvement in the residency came with an invitation to attend WILD x NOLA. It was definitely a great party. But as we all know, good parties foster a sense of community with the potential of leading to incredible ideas and projects. Beyond a tool for marketing or creating cultural capital; such events allow to build genuine connections.  

WILD x NOLA brought together brilliant minds that creatively shape the art & blockchain ecosystem. I witnessed spontaneous exchanges, collaborations, and a deep dive into the creative possibilities of digital art. The event was a testament to Wild's mission of magnifying art and building uncharted worlds.  

These events offer opportunities to have unmediated discussions about a variety of online projects. One of my NFT-based projects that I discussed in New Orleans is the [Infinite Canvas](https://vncnt.xyz/infinite-canvas), a collective experiment made of an ever expanding collection of colours. This artwork on Ethereum is a testament to the collaborative spirit of onchain permisionessless. Here's how it works:  
- Anyone can mint a token
- Each token buyer chooses its token's colour  
- Owners have the freedom to change the colour of their token as often as they wish.  
- Collectively, these tokens form the infinite canvas.  

This project with its unlimited supply allows for an ever-evolving artwork where the community actively participates in its creation. Think [r/place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/place) meets the [Million Token Website](https://milliontokenwebsite.com/) but with an added *infinity* factor.

My discussion on the Infinite Canvas went beyond just the mechanics. We delved into ways of empowering token holders to decide on the layout of the canvas online. Imagine that collection of NFTs, each token becoming a pixel on the canvas. These tokens can be laid out in a multitude of arrangements, allowing the canvas to come together in diverse and imaginative ways. It's a dynamic interplay between individual creativity and collective vision, and you can witness this evolving collaboration at[ vncnt.xyz/infinite-canvas](https://vncnt.xyz/infinite-canvas).  


The success of the WILD x NOLA event came from the wide variety of topics covered, ranging from a performative showcase of [aesthetic.computer](http://aesthetic.computer) to a workshop on how to prepare work for collectors. From the playfulness of a whistlegraph to the technicalities of institutional archiving, I navigated the different sessions with increasing enthusiasm. On our final night, [a marching band walked us](https://twitter.com/jtchomko/status/1712910024308093020) to our final venue to everyone’s surprise.   


Before diving into the specifics of other artworks, let's take a moment to understand what I mean by 'Boolean Art.' This term, which I coin here for the sake of this post, refers to artworks that ingeniously incorporate the boolean data type — a fundamental concept in computing representing true/false or yes/no decisions — to weave intricate narratives and experiences. Boolean Art leverages this binary simplicity to delve into complex, often multifaceted themes, challenging the viewer to consider the nuanced intersections between technology, art and human experience.

From all the artists present at the event in New Orleans, I want to highlight three pieces of art that make use of the specificity of the medium through the use of the boolean data type. These 3 works fall into what I described above as 'Boolean Art.' Artists like Rhea Myers, with "[Is Art](https://rhea.art/is-art/)" Stevie Pikelny's "[Have You Tried Turning It Off and On Again?](https://unitlondon.com/nfts/have-you-tried-turning-it-off-and-on-again/)", and my own "[Consecutive Days at the Studio](https://vincent.charlebois.info/am-i/)" do more than manipulate boolean data; they act as Le Guin-esque carrier bags, each boolean value holding a story, a question, or a provocation, engaging deeply with the viewer's perception and experience. The use of booleans to explore complex narratives transcend simple 'true or false' dichotomies. These works highlight the multidimensional opportunities of smart contracts as an artistic medium.

In the larger landscape of NFTs, each token, each smart contract, much like Le Guin's carrier bags, holds within it a microcosm of narratives: the artist's vision, the community's interaction, the blockchain's immutable history, and the endless potentialities of these intersections.

Echoing Le Guin's "Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction," I now propose the "Carrier Bag Theory of Infrastructure," enriched by my recent experiences at the [Autonomous Worlds Assembly](https://aw.network/2023) in Istanbul. This event was a revelation, introducing me to an array of incredible people that presented fascinating concepts such as decentralized narratives, abstraction leaks, and composable worldbuilding. The discussions and insights gained there have profoundly deepened my understanding of these groundbreaking, autonomous worlds.

As we delve deeper into digital art and blockchain, I see our creations — smart contracts, NFTs, decentralized networks — as modern carrier bags, holding codes, transactions, stories, and cultural narratives. These experiences have invigorated my curiosity to continue building experiments and prototypes onchain, exploring the limitless potential of this medium. Looking ahead, I'm committed to not only participating in but actively shaping the future of this vibrant and evolving landscape of blockchain and creative worldling.
