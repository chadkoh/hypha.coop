Learnings

* Coop scaling & growth: Across all industries, worker coops seem to thrive at the 15-25 person size
    * Reflect on capitalistic demand for growth at all costs
    * Decision-making requires high context
* Lots of different decision-making tools
    * Percolab’s workshop - be intentional about scope, constraints, participation, method.
        * Various methods for deciison-making — useful to learn that all methods are valid and useful. Not all coop decisions must be 100% consensus-based
    * Talking with Guillaume at Mambo Mambo - 7 member owners, everyone is on board, board sets strategy, committees execute on strategy. Ability to wear many hats and be intentional about when you’re in strategy vs execution mode
* Time and focus is our scarcest resource
    * Validation that no one ever feels like they have enough time for things but interesting to hear what other coops are prioritizing: wages, holding onto real estate, 
* Worker coops have come a long way in the last few decades, but we still have a lot of work left to do on sustainability, diversity, and inclusion
