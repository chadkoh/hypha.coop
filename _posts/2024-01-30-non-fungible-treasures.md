### {{ page.excerpt }}

As an artist immersed in the realms of blockchain and smart contract art, I had the pleasure in early October to attend an event hosted by Wild in New Orleans. There, amidst a diverse assembly of artists and thinkers, I engaged in rich dialogues about the affordances of decentralised technologies. This experience served not just as a great party and networking occasion but as a fertile ground for exchanging ideas on NFTs, further enriching my perspective on their untapped potential.

Wild is a platform celebrating art and creativity in the digital age. Their primary objective is to empower artists with tools for growth, to provide space for creativity, and to introduce their art to a wider audience. My involvement in the residency came with an invitation to attend WILD x NOLA. It was definitely a great party. But as most know, good parties foster a sense of community with the potential of leading to novel ideas and projects. Beyond a tool for marketing or creating cultural capital, such events allow to build genuine connections. Yet, despite the positive momentum, misconceptions about NFTs persist.  

"NFTs are worthless!"—this statement, frequently used as a click-bait headline— casually dismisses the possibilities enabled by distributed databases such as blockchains. Beyond proving the bullshit asymmetry principle otherwise known as Brandolini's Law, such statements, other than showing a definitive lack of nuance, serve as a reminder of the misconception towards the affordances of such decentralized technologies. As an artist committed to research and exploration, my curiosity tends to lead me towards the potentialities opened up by a specific medium. I see NFTs as a tool that can explore the social, financial, and technical ramifications of blockchains, offering a unique avenue for creativity. It is this interest in distributed ledgers as a vehicle for creativity that has led me to take part in season 2 of [Wild](https://wild.xyz)'s residency. Embracing these potentialities, my journey led me to initiate the "Hawking Radiation", a practical exploration of these concepts that builds on top of the Blackhole project.

Since returning from this invigorating environment, I have not only launched the "Hawking Radiation" project but also attended the Autonomous Worlds Assembly, both endeavors representing further explorations within the creative realm enabled by decentralised technologies. Drawing inspiration from Ursula K. Le Guin's "[Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction](https://otherfutures.nl/uploads/documents/le-guin-the-carrier-bag-theory-of-fiction.pdf)," which views stories as vessels for collective human experiences, I've been exploring smart contracts as modern "carrier bags." These are the digital narratives and artistic expressions that hold the potential to shape new worlds and experiences—a concept I have been keenly developing throughout different projects. 

Among the innovative NFT projects that caught my attention last year was the [Blackhole](https://blackhole.eth.limo/), a minimal yet profound smart contract art piece. In essence, it’s a digital representation of a black hole where participants can interact by minting or burning NFTs, affecting its state and the cost of future interactions. Each action directly influences the Blackhole's lifecycle, echoing the unpredictable and dynamic nature of its cosmic namesake.

Fascinated by this project, I ventured to create the [Hawking Radiation](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9dCEaa80E2500B519090a6d8a1FfeDfe224Ceb8D#code), a smart contract enabling a collective approach to interacting with the Blackhole. This initiative allowed participants to burn their tokens via the Hawking Radiation mechanism, turning the individualistic experience into a shared mission. The goal was to socialize the experiment, fostering a community-driven effort to "play" the Blackhole in a cooperative mode. This shift not only added a layer of social dynamics to the experience but also highlighted the potential of blockchain for creating collaborative and collective art experiences. This spirit of collaboration and innovation was one that was amplified at WILD x NOLA, where artists and curators converged to reimagine the future of digital art onchain.

WILD x NOLA brought together brilliant minds that creatively shape the art & blockchain ecosystem. I witnessed spontaneous exchanges, collaborations, and a deep dive into the creative possibilities of digital art. The event was a testament to Wild's mission of magnifying art and building uncharted worlds.  

This event in New Orleans offered opportunities to have unmediated and devirtualized discussions about a variety of online projects. One of the NFT-based projects that I discussed was the [Infinite Canvas](https://ecanvas.eth.limo), a collective experiment made of an ever expanding collection of colours. This artwork on Ethereum is an artistic statement that highlights the collaborative spirit of onchain permisionessless. Here's how it works:  
- Anyone can mint a token
- Each token buyer chooses its token's colour  
- Owners have the freedom to change the colour of their token as often as they wish.  
- Collectively, these tokens form an infinite canvas.  

This project with its unlimited supply allows for an ever-evolving artwork where the community actively participates in its creation. Think [r/place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/place) meets the [Million Token Website](https://milliontokenwebsite.com/) but with an added *infinity* factor.

Our discussions relating to the Infinite Canvas went beyond just its mechanics. We delved into ways of empowering token holders to decide on the layout of the canvas online. Imagine that collection of NFTs, each token becoming a pixel on the canvas. These tokens can be laid out in a multitude of arrangements, allowing the canvas to come together in diverse and imaginative ways. It's a dynamic interplay between individual creativity and collective vision. This constitutes an evolving colour-based collaboration. 

The success of the WILD x NOLA event came from the wide variety of topics covered, ranging from a performative showcase of [aesthetic.computer](http://aesthetic.computer) to a workshop on how to prepare work for collectors. From the playfulness of a whistlegraph to the technicalities of institutional archiving, I navigated the different sessions with increasing enthusiasm. On our final night, [a marching band walked us](https://twitter.com/jtchomko/status/1712910024308093020) to our final venue to everyone’s surprise. Navigating through such a diverse landscape of ideas, I was inspired to define a new concept in digital art that I call "Boolean Art."

Before I discuss further artworks, let's take a moment to understand what I define as "Boolean Art." This term, which I coin here for the sake of this post, refers to artworks that ingeniously incorporate the boolean data type — a fundamental concept in computing representing "true/false" or "yes/no" decisions — to weave intricate narratives and experiences. Boolean Art leverages this binary simplicity to delve into complex, often multifaceted themes, challenging the viewer to consider the nuanced intersections between technology, art and human experience beyond simple statements.

From all the artists present at the event in New Orleans, I want to highlight three pieces of art that make use of the specificity of the medium through the use of the boolean data type. These 3 works fall into what I described above as "Boolean Art." Artists like Rhea Myers, with "[Is Art](https://rhea.art/is-art/)", Stevie Pikelny's "[Have You Tried Turning It Off and On Again?](https://unitlondon.com/nfts/have-you-tried-turning-it-off-and-on-again/)", and my own "[Consecutive Days at the Studio](https://vincent.charlebois.info/am-i/)" do more than manipulate boolean data; they act as Le Guin-esque carrier bags, each boolean value holding a story, a question, or a provocation, engaging with the viewer's perception and experience. The use of booleans to explore complex narratives transcend simple "true or false" dichotomies. These works highlight the multidimensional opportunities of smart contracts as an artistic medium.

In the larger landscape of NFTs, each token, each smart contract, much like Le Guin's carrier bags, holds within it a microcosm of narratives: the artist's vision, the community's interaction, the blockchain's immutable history, and the endless potentialities of these intersections.

Echoing Le Guin's "Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction," I now propose the "Carrier Bag Theory of Infrastructure," enriched by my recent experiences at the [Autonomous Worlds Assembly](https://aw.network/) in Istanbul. This event was a revelation, introducing me to an array of incredible people that presented fascinating concepts such as decentralized narratives, abstraction leaks, and composable worldbuilding. The discussions and insights gained there have profoundly deepened my understanding of these groundbreaking, autonomous worlds.

As we delve deeper into digital art and blockchain, I see our creations — smart contracts, NFTs, decentralized networks — as modern carrier bags, holding codes, transactions, stories, and cultural narratives. These experiences have invigorated my curiosity to continue building experiments and prototypes onchain, exploring the potential of this medium. Looking ahead, I'm committed to not only be participating in but actively shaping the future of this vibrant and evolving landscape of creative blockchain worldling.

Lots has happened since I originally wrote this post. The "Hawking Radiation" managed to dissolve the Blackhole. I deployed Acclivities, a smart contract that interfaces and expands upon the Infinite Canvas. Additionally, the Autonomous Worlds Assembly published all the talks from the conference in Istanbul on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZAxQO5qOAFYmP8T2pE-LihtVWbbgpCjR). Yet, there is still a lot that remains unsaid about these non-fungible treasures and you can rest assured I have a follow-up post that will expand on what was initiated here.
