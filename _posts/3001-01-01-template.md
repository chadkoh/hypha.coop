### {{ page.excerpt }}

<figcaption>Figure caption goes here</figcaption>
</figure>

Article starts as above with page excerpt then an introductory image. Images should be the only content requiring html tags, all other formatting can use markdown syntax.

Lists like so
* Unordered list item
* Unordered list item

> Block quotes like so

You can also insert images with markdown more simply, but then they will not be wrapped in the figure tag with the figcaption tag, which is less good for accessibility. If you don't have a caption, this is fine though, and can be done like so:
