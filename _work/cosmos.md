Hypha is a [Cosmos Hub](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-overview/overview.html) core team and Interchain Foundation grant recipient, focusing on governance and testnet management. Our governance goals are to improve deliberation among stakeholders by stewarding thoughtful and values-oriented decision making. We manage Cosmos Hub testnets where we run infrastructure and coordinate with validators, developers, and users to test software releases and build technical capacity in the ecosystem.
