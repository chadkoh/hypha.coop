Hypha is collaborating with <a href="https://countermap.land">Countermap.land</a>, a non-profit organization exploring relationships between heritage and power. The first phase of the project resulted in a prototype that displays a limited set of monument and countermonument data. Future iterations will include the first comprehensive monument dataset for the territory known as Canada, and will offer space for reimagining monument futures that challenge current systems of power.
