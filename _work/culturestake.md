Hypha collaborated with [Furtherfield](https://www.furtherfield.org/) to launch an enhanced version of the CultureStake app, a tool for promoting inclusive and equitable cultural decision-making through a unique quadratic voting system. <!-- more --> [CultureStake](https://culturestake.org/) is a quadratic voting app deployed on the Gnosis blockchain.
