            Furtherfield is an art gallery that’s been uniquely located in the heart of North London’s Finsbury Park since 2011. When COVID made its indoor space unmanageable, the Furtherfield team took it as an opportunity to reset its relationship with the Finsbury community. As a result, they not only brought their work outdoors, but also created CultureStake, a blockchain app that lets any cultural organization open up decision making to the public.

                Formed in response to the celebrity and commercialization of London’s YBA scene in the 90’s, for almost three decades Furtherfield has embodied the grassroots DIY culture of the early internet for artists. Even though the pandemic was the catalyst for CultureStake, the team had been ready to make a change. “We had a growing feeling that bringing art from our international network into this public space was us bestowing ‘good culture’ on a locality, and we were becoming increasingly uncomfortable with it,” co-founder Ruth Catlow explains. “We wanted to work more with the different communities that used this space to see how they might shape our programs and our organization, and realized we could ask them directly about what was important to them.”

                    As longtime followers of open source and peer-to-peer technologies, and as explorers of how emerging tech impacts society, the Furtherfield team knew they wanted to incorporate two specific decentralized tools into CultureStake:

<ol class="f3 measure-wide">
    <li>
        Quadratic voting (QV), which in contrast to one person, one vote and ranked choice systems, lets voters express both their preferences and how strong they are. QV does this by giving voters a set of credits to “spend.” Voting for the same choice multiple times “costs” more and more credits with each vote, so if you feel very strongly about something, it’s reflected. The benefit, Ruth says, is that “QV provides nuanced information about why voters want something instead of just which outcomes they want.”

    </li>
    <li>
        Blockchain to record the votes, which Ruth characterizes as “an immutable public record that lets people know we haven’t messed with their votes.”
    </li>
</ol>
