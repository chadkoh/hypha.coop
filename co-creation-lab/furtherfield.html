        <a href="https://www.furtherfield.org/"> Furtherfield</a> is an art gallery that’s been uniquely located in the heart
        of North London’s Finsbury Park since 2011. When COVID made its indoor
        space unmanageable, the Furtherfield team took it as an opportunity to
        reset its relationship with the Finsbury community. As a result, they
        not only brought their work outdoors, but also created CultureStake, a
        blockchain app that lets any cultural organization open up decision
        making to the public.

        Formed in response to the celebrity and commercialization of <a href=" https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/y/young-british-artists-ybas"> London’s
        YBA scene</a> in the 90’s, for almost three decades Furtherfield has
        embodied the grassroots DIY culture of the early internet for artists.
        Even though the pandemic was the catalyst for CultureStake, the team had
        been ready to make a change. “We had a growing feeling that bringing art
        from our international network into this public space was us bestowing
        ‘good culture’ on a locality, and we were becoming increasingly
        uncomfortable with it,” co-founder <a href= "https://ruthcatlow.net/"> Ruth Catlow </a> explains. “We wanted to
        work more with the different communities that used this space to see how
        they might shape our programs and our organization, and realized we
        could ask them directly about what was important to them.”

        As longtime followers of open source and peer-to-peer technologies, and
        as explorers of how emerging tech impacts society, the Furtherfield team
        knew they wanted to incorporate two specific decentralized tools into
        <a href="https://www.furtherfield.org/culturestake/"> CultureStake</a>:
      </p>
      <ol class="f3 measure-wide">
        <li>
          Quadratic voting (QV), which in contrast to one person, one vote and
          ranked choice systems, lets voters express both their preferences and
          how strong they are. QV does this by giving voters a set of credits to
          “spend.” Voting for the same choice multiple times “costs” more and
          more credits with each vote, so if you feel very strongly about
          something, it’s reflected. The benefit, Ruth says, is that “QV
          provides nuanced information about why voters want something instead
          of just which outcomes they want.”
        </li>
        <li>
          Blockchain to record the votes, which Ruth characterizes as “an
          immutable public record that lets people know we haven’t messed with
          their votes.”
        </li>
      </ol>

        “Without Hypha, we would’ve been at the end of the road and had to put
        the project to bed.”
      </h4>

      <p class="pb3 f3 lh-copy measure-wide">
        For CultureStake’s first iteration, Furtherfield commissioned artist and
        developer <a href="https://isthisa.com/"> Sarah Friend</a> and later brought in fellow co-op <a href= "https://commonknowledge.coop/practices/" Common
        Knowledge </a> to work on its design and frontend. But when it came to the
        more challenging backend work of connecting the app to the blockchain,
        both Sarah and the firm recommended Hypha. At first, Furtherfield was
        nervous about handing the project to a new partner. Says Ruth, ”We were
        a little bit freaked out because we didn’t have a bunch of extra funding
        if things went wrong. We had to be sure this would work.” But then
        Furtherfield met with the Hypha team. “They asked really good questions.
        That’s how we came to feel, ‘Yes, this is doable.’”
      </p>
      <p class="pb3 f3 lh-copy measure-wide">
        As the work began, Ruth loved Hypha’s rigorous approach: “After every
        meeting, Hypha’s notes would reflect back to us everything we described
        along with anything that was still unknown, that they wanted additional
        information on, or had questions or comments about.” Through this
        process, Ruth says, “They kept asking questions until they knew
        everything. This made us feel very secure because we could see all the
        remaining gaps.” In addition to making the app functional — making the
        frontend do what it was intended to do — as planned, Hypha helped
        improve the design of CultureStake’s frontend as well.

        As Furtherfield “turned the gallery inside out,” bringing art from the
        gallery to the park, they used CultureStake to cede creative control to
        the people. Calling the project <a href="https://www.furtherfield.org/peoples-park-plinth/"> People’s Park Plinth </a>, Furtherfield
        commissioned a series of small extended reality artworks. Finsbury’s
        50,000 visitors a week could then use CultureStake to scan QR codes and
        view the works throughout the park. They then could use CultureStake to
        vote on which piece they wanted to see realized at full scale. As part
        of CultureStake’s design, votes cast from within the park were weighted
        higher than ones made from outside it. That year, Furtherfield tripled
        its local engagement and heard feedback like, “I’ve been talking about
        this with my friends for months.”

      <p class="pb3 f3 lh-copy measure-wide">
        When asked about her overall experience working with Hypha, Ruth
        responded, “I trusted them. I always felt like we were working with good
        people. Without Hypha, we would’ve been at the end of the road and had
        to put the project to bed.”

        Confirming the usefulness and untapped potential of blockchain for art
        and culture

      <p class="pb3 f3 lh-copy measure-wide">
        Because of recent changes to the Furtherfield team, Ruth is now seeking
        funding to support CultureStake’s continued growth. Even though
        CultureStake’s future is uncertain, Ruth says the project confirmed for
        her the “massive and still underexplored value quadratic voting has in
        the cultural setting.”
      </p>
      <p class="pb3 f3 lh-copy measure-wide">
        Reflects Ruth, “In trying to make a connection with our local community
        to understand our shared interests, CultureStake allowed for a radical
        inversion of how you usually run a gallery. It responded to a pragmatic
        issue with COVID, but also the desire for more authentic relationships
        with the public around us.”
      </p>
      <p class="pb3 f3 lh-copy measure-wide">
        “Testing all the promises of democratization in the blockchain space
        against reality” was something Ruth had been wanting to do ever since
        Furtherfield board member <a href="https://rhea.art/"> Rhea Myers</a> started “issuing provocations on
        decentralized autonomous organizations that were impossible to ignore,
        long before the NFT boom.” To her, blockchain may not be essential to
        making cultural democracy happen. But Ruth feels it’s important to keep
        the spirit of DIY experimentation alive for this generation of the
        internet so blockchain isn’t only used for financial extraction. Hypha’s
        Co-Creation Lab gives organizations like Furtherfield the expertise they
        need to safely explore these possibilities.
