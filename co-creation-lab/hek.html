        Switzerland’s HEK (House of Electronic Arts) has been the leading museum
        for digital art, media, and culture since 2011. As a center of creative
        technology, HEK aims to be at the forefront of what’s relevant,
        willingly pushing into areas that are unknown and undefined — areas that
        include blockchain and Web3.

        Turning standard museum membership into an experiment in digital
        community engagement
      </h4>
      <p class="pb3 f3 lh-copy measure-wide">
        Even though HEK had done Web3-related projects by 2023, the team had the
        feeling that they were behind on the community-building potential of the
        technology. At the same time, HEK wanted to evolve its membership
        program beyond simply offering free museum entrance for 25 francs a
        year. Putting these two opportunities together, the vision for Friends
        of HEK, a museum membership that gives HEK members online experiences
        and decision-making power, was born.

      <p class="pb3 f3 lh-copy measure-wide">
        Friends of HEK was going to be the biggest tech implementation HEK had
        done in years. And if they pulled it off, HEK would become the first
        museum to tokenize its membership program. HEK needed a tech development
        partner to make their ambitious vision a reality, but not any company
        would do. Beyond being a logical experiment in Web3 technology, “Friends
        of HEK is an attempt to break down the usual hierarchies between
        institution and consumer into a community space that’s still structured
        and facilitated, but where members really feel ownership,” says HEK’s
        education coordinator Isabella Maund. HEK needed a partner that didn’t
        just build technology, but that would do it with care.

      <p class="pb3 f3 lh-copy measure-wide">
        HEK met with different companies specializing in Web3 development, but
        none of them engaged with the museum’s mission, goals, or mindset,
        instead focusing only on cost. Then they spoke to Hypha, who came
        recommended by HEK artist Sarah Friend.

      <p class="pb3 f3 lh-copy measure-wide">
        Hypha understood HEK on a deep level. “In the first meeting with Hypha,
        it was quite obvious that they were the right partner for us as a
        cultural institution,” says Ugo Pecoraio, HEK’s Head Of Communications.
        “They were open to new ideas and different approaches, but could also
        bring art, culture, and technology together in an uncomplicated way.”

        Close collaboration to get years of thinking pared down and off the

      </h4>
      <p class="pb3 f3 lh-copy measure-wide">
        As the partnership kicked off, Hypha’ worked with HEK to:
      </p>

      <ol class="f3 measure-wide">
        <li>
          Deepen the team’s Web3 knowledge beyond the basics into its technical
          aspects and culture
        </li>
        <li>
          Ask questions to uncover true needs, priorities, and hidden
          assumptions behind HEK’s project proposal
        </li>
      </ol>
      <blockquote class="f3 measure mb5">
        <em>
          “It was quite refreshing for Hypha to say, ‘That’s a great idea, but
          maybe we have to do it in a different way.’”
        </em>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="pb3 f3 lh-copy measure-wide">
        Ugo elaborates: “We had a lot of ideas that were just that — ideas, not
        things that could be done fast and within budget, would let us evolve,
        or that really benefited the community.” Through Hypha’s process, “We
        naturally came to understand what’s possible for the community. It was
        quite refreshing for Hypha to not just say, ‘That’s a stupid idea.’
        Instead they’d say, ‘That’s a great idea, but maybe we have to do it in
        a different way.’”

        Guiding HEK through the challenges of introducing its community to Web3
      </h4>
      <p class="pb3 f3 lh-copy measure-wide">
        Once the plan for Friends of HEK was finalized, it was time to build the
        technology. But every custom project comes with problems and changes.
        One of the issues that arose was making purchasing a Friends of HEK
        membership work with HEK’s existing payment systems. Blockchains let
        communities engage in new ways, namely community voting that’s more
        experiential and transparent in Friends of HEK’s case. To unlock these
        capabilities, each Friends of HEK membership is associated with a
        digital asset called an NFT, which are usually purchased using
        cryptocurrency. It was important to HEK, however, that members could
        still pay with “a good old credit card” in addition to Ethereum.
      </p>
      <p class="pb3 f3 lh-copy measure-wide">
        There are many providers that enable the sale of NFTs via traditional
        payment methods, but none of them worked well with the payment systems
        HEK was already using. To find the most reliable way forward, Hypha
        presented different options while informing HEK about the tradeoffs they
        entailed so the HEK team could make the best choice.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="f3 measure mb5">
        <em>
          “The Hypha team had the expertise to solve roadblocks, both
          conceptually and technically, which really gave us a sense of
          security.”
        </em>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="pb3 f3 lh-copy measure-wide">
        Another challenge Hypha helped HEK navigate came from a public comment
        that questioned HEK’s motivations in creating Friends of HEK. Would the
        direction of the program really be decided by voters instead of the
        museum? Or would the HEK team be pulling the strings? Again, the Hypha
        team helped HEK think through how to approach the problem, structure
        solutions, and in this case, how to handle the public messaging. As a
        result, HEK ended up putting its own influence over the program up for
        community vote. No one voted against HEK team members being able to vote
        or make Friends of HEK proposals, so the team was able to continue on
        with confidence that it was working in harmony with the community’s
        interests.
      </p>
      <p class="pb3 f3 lh-copy measure-wide">
        Of Hypha’s problem-solving abilities, Isabella remarks: “The Hypha team
        had the expertise to solve both conceptual and technical roadblocks,
        which really gave us a sense of security. We had a lot of shifting
        timelines, but they were able to keep us on track.”
      </p>
      <h4 class="f3 measure-wide mb0">
        Providing a model for community tech for the art world
      </h4>
      <p class="pb3 f3 lh-copy measure-wide">
        After 3 months of development, Friends of HEK launched in July 2023 to
        much buzz. Says Isabella, “Friends of HEK’s role in helping us gain a
        new awareness and respect has been clear from how much other people talk
        about it and how many times we’ve been invited to talk about it.”
      </p>
      <p class="pb3 f3 lh-copy measure-wide">
        The interest the project received told the HEK team that they had
        fulfilled their goal of making Friends of HEK a model for other
        community-oriented arts and culture institutions. “Hypha helped us hit
        many milestones for Friends of HEK, and in a way people could
        understand,” Ugo shared. “That was the goal — to be the first museum to
        launch a tokenized membership, and to be helpful to other institutions
        who want to do the same.”
      </p>
      <blockquote class="f3 measure mb5">
        <em>
          “Friends of HEK’s role in helping us gain a new awareness and respect
          has been clear.”
        </em>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="pb3 f3 lh-copy measure-wide">
        Building holistic tech that is accessible to users and sustainable for
        clients is core to all of Hypha’s work. To serve those ends for HEK,
        Hypha was active in the creation of the Friends of HEK Handbook,
        providing feedback on making the structure and language friendly to a
        general audience. Hypha also left the HEK team with thorough
        documentation they could reference as they took over the tech for
        themselves.
      </p>
      <p class="pb3 f3 lh-copy measure-wide">
        Reflecting on HEK’s partnership with Hypha, Isabella reaffirmed HEK’s
        belief that art and technology aren’t separate: “I’ve been guilty of
        thinking Web3 was just for people who want to make a bunch of money, but
        that’s only one side of it. There’s so much more to Web3 that can be
        recontextualized for the art world. That’s our focus at HEK — opening
        these doors.” Adds Ugo, “The art world shouldn’t be so scared of new
        technology because it can be beautiful, especially for communities.”
