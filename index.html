  - title: Decentralized web projects
    description: We build decentralized web protocols (see our <a href="https://distributed.press/">Distributed Press initiative</a>) and contribute to distributed ledger and blockchain-based projects. Hypha believes peer-to-peer technologies will transform traditional digital hierarchies.
  - title: Capacity Development
    description: "Capacity development is context dependent: we collaborate to understand where you are and where you need to go. If you’re a co-operative or a collective, Hypha has the lived experience and technical expertise to help you flourish."
  - title: Governance guidance
    description: We’re a co-op, so we know about the intricacies of working in a coordinated and democratic way. Hypha advises on decentralized governance challenges, and helps cultivate community ownership strategies.
values:
  - title: Curiosity
    description: We embrace diverse perspectives, and approach our work with wonder and openness. We move thoughtfully and joyfully toward the futures we imagine.
  - title: Honesty
    description: We strive to be clear and direct in our communication with each other and those with whom we collaborate. We endeavour to gracefully accept, and act on, feedback when it is given.
  - title: Intersectionality
    description: We recognize, and work across, differences. We acknowledge the ongoing history of oppression and marginalization in our society and workplaces, and strive for Hypha to be a safe harbour to all. 
  - title: Self-Agency
    description: We choose the projects we work on. We are committed to upholding the financial security of our members and collaborators by fairly valuing the work we do.
  - title: Solidarity
