# Scripts to generate Social Cards from all Dripline post

## Description

This folder contains 2 scripts.

One generates images from a post's title, excerpt and author
The second script adds the 'image' variable pointing to the image in the post's front matter.

## WIP

These scripts are a work in progress. Be sure to read the comments before running these scripts.
You will need to change paths or move the scripts to the adequate folder.
The editPosts.sh script currently writes duplicated 'image' variables and required some manual editing.
This duplication should be looked into for full automation and to prevent the currently needed manual fixes.
